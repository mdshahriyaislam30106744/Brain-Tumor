# Intelligent Diagnosis of Brain Tumors: A Deep Learning based Brain Tumor Detection in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scans

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis on brain tumor classification using deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately classify various types of brain tumors based on medical imaging data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes MRI images of different brain tumor types, such as:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.12
- TensorFlow 2.11.0
- Pandas 1.3.5
- Matplotlib 3.5.3
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Brain-Tumor-main`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Follow the instructions to download the dataset to the `Brain-Tumor-main/Dataset` directory.
5. Run the model training notebook: `Brian-tumor-classification`
